# Statistics-CLI

A *currently* very basic CLI for some stats stuff. It can list and it can summarize a numerical dataset. For 2D data it may also plot it.

    wstat set=1,2,3 list

Will print something like this

    
	1.000000000
    2.000000000
    3.000000000

You can also do `wstat set=1,2,3 operation=list` if you're not a fan of the shorthand. The command line arguments can go in any order. For example `wstat list set=1,2,3` is equally valid. In addition, `list` is the default opperation, so `wstat set=1,2,3` is enough. If you specify your set in one of the additional ways below, you can get away with just `wstat`

## Summarizing a Dataset

Lists are cool and all, but at the end of the day, what you care about is probably more down here. `wstat set=1,2,3 summary` will print something like this:

	Min             Q1              Med             Q3              Max
	1.000000000     1.000000000     2.000000000     3.000000000     3.000000000

    Mean            Std. Dev. (s)   Std. Dev. (Ïƒ)
    2.000000000     1.000000000     0.816496581
    
## Outlier Detection

You can also use this `summary` command to indicate potential outliers. They will be right under your normal summary.

## Correlation

Type `correlate` or `correlation` to print the `r` correlation coefficient

## Using stdin and the Pipe Operator

It's not terribly convenient to pass in everything as a command line argument, so you can pass in your set into stdin. This means that if `rng` is a command that creates a comma-separated list of numbers, `rng | wstat summary` will let you summarize that list easily.

In addition, you can also give no input and no command-line parameters: `wstat summary` and the console will let you write your input, which will be read when you hit enter. This is useful when you are copy-pasting your dataset from elsewhere.

## Output (text, json or csv)

Currently json, csv and text output are supported. Text is the default. You can specify with `wstat list json` or `wstat list text`. The full version is `wstat operation=list output=json`. The same information is given in both the list and the summary, it's just displayed differently. Please note that the only operation that supports CSV output is List.

## Multivariable Sets

This supports n-dimensions, just add `dimensions=2` to your command. A shorthand in the case of 2-D data, is `2var`. If you have 3+ dimensional data, you need to use `dimensions=3`

## Plotting 2-D Sets

Pretty simple, just do `wstat 2var plot` and once you type in your data it will give you the filepath.

For example, a set like this: `(-3,9),(-2,4),(-1,1),(0,0),(1,1),(2,4),(3,9)`

Would produce a plot like this:

![Plot](/demo/plot_2019-10-28___08-30-46_PM.bmp)

The parantheses around points are optional, I include them because I prefer the notation, especially for a demo/tutorial.

## Linear Regression

Add a `linreg` to your plot command `wstat 2var plot linreg` and it will give you a printout as well as draw the Least Square Regression Line on the graph. `linreg` is a shorthand for `options=linreg`, if you use multiple options you can do `options=option1,linreg,option3` or you can use the shorthands together.

For the set `-2,2,2,0.11134,0,0.8` I got this plot:
![linreg Plot](/demo/plot_2019-10-28___08-28-04_PM.bmp)

And this printout: 
	
	    y=a+bx
		
        a=0.9704466666666667
        b=-0.472165


        Filepath: C:\Users\benny\source\repos\stat\statistics-cli/plots/plot_2019-10-28___08-35-24_PM.bmp
		
## Reexpression

Add a `reexpress`, and then choose either `zscore` or `residual` as an option. `zscore` works on N-Dimensional sets, `residual` requires a 2-Dimensional set. `residual` also requires you specify the regression line to use.

`wstat reexpress zscore` will standardize a 1-Dimensional set.

`wstat reexpress zscore 2var` for 2 dimensions.

`wstat reexpress zscore dimensions=<n>` for n dimensions.

`wstat reexpress residual 2var linreg` will print the residual set for a linear regression line in two dimensions.

## Open Source

This project is a very low priority for me, so if you decide to open some pull-requests to add features or otherwise improve code quality I would be very thankful.

Please note, I would like to have CI sorted out on PRs, however github actions is not currently cooperating with .NET Core 3.0, so we are currently stuck without it.
